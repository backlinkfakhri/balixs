They offer a blend of strength, durability, and aesthetics. Typically, in Bali, they range from Rp. 4,000,000 to Rp. 6,500,000 (approx. AUD 400 to AUD 650) per veneer. The entire process, from consultation to having them cemented in place, usually spans 7 to 9 days.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Composite Veneers:<\/strong><br \/>\nAn economical choice, composite veneers come in at Rp. 1,000,000 to Rp. 1,500,000 (approx. AUD 100 to AUD 150) for each veneer. While their lifespan might be shorter than their porcelain counterparts, they have a unique advantage \u2013 any damage can be rectified with relative ease.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Ceramic Veneers:<\/strong><br \/>\nTreading the middle path between porcelain and composite, both in terms of price and durability, are the ceramic veneers. You can expect to part with about Rp. 2,000,000 (approx. AUD 200) for each.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Zirconia Veneers:<\/strong><br \/>\nStrength is the hallmark of zirconia veneers, especially suitable for those back teeth that endure the most grinding and pressure. They are priced at around Rp. 6,000,000 (approx. AUD 600) per veneer.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Emax Veneers:<\/strong><br \/>\nFor those who value brand specifics, E-Max Ivoclar veneers stand out. Starting from Rp. 6,500,000 (approx. AUD 650), they encompass a range of dental solutions including crowns, inlays, overlays, and of course, veneers.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Veneers cost in Bali is a common query, as navigating through these choices can feel overwhelming.
